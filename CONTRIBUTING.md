# 🤝 Contributing to Angular Design Patterns

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Angular Design Patterns! This guide will help you understand how to contribute effectively.

## 🎯 How to Contribute

### 1. **Report Issues**
Found a bug or have a suggestion? Create an issue:
- Use the issue templates
- Provide clear descriptions
- Include reproduction steps
- Add screenshots if relevant

### 2. **Submit Patterns**
Have a great Angular pattern to share? Here's how:

#### Pattern Requirements
- ✅ **Must be production-ready** - Tested in real projects
- ✅ **Self-contained** - Can run independently
- ✅ **Well-documented** - Clear README with examples
- ✅ **Follows Angular best practices** - Uses latest Angular features
- ✅ **Includes tests** - Unit tests for components/services
- ✅ **TypeScript strict mode** - No `any` types unless necessary

#### Pattern Structure
```

│   │   ├── package.json
│   │   ├── angular.json
│   │   ├── tsconfig.json
│   │   └── .gitignore
```

#### Documentation Requirements
Each pattern must include:
- **Problem Statement** - What problem does this solve?
- **Solution Overview** - How does it work?
- **Implementation Steps** - Step-by-step guide
- **Usage Examples** - Code examples
- **Best Practices** - Tips and recommendations
- **Common Pitfalls** - What to avoid
- **Dependencies** - Required packages
- **Testing** - How to test the pattern

### 3. **Improve Documentation**
- Fix typos and grammar
- Add more examples
- Improve explanations
- Update outdated information

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Angular CLI (v15 or higher)
- Git

### Setup
```bash
# Fork the repository
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Angular-Design-Patterns.git

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/Angular-Design-Patterns.git

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-pattern-name
```

### Development Workflow
1. **Create your pattern** in the appropriate category
2. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure it works correctly
3. **Document properly** - Write comprehensive README
4. **Commit with clear messages** - Use conventional commits
5. **Push to your fork**
6. **Create a pull request**

## 📝 Commit Guidelines

Use conventional commit messages:
```
feat: add reactive forms validation pattern
fix: correct HTTP interceptor error handling
docs: update README with new examples
test: add unit tests for service layer pattern
```

## 🔍 Code Review Process

1. **Self-review** - Test your pattern thoroughly
2. **Community review** - Maintainers and contributors review
3. **Address feedback** - Make requested changes
4. **Merge** - Once approved, your pattern is merged

## 🎨 Style Guidelines

### Angular Code
- Follow [Angular Style Guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide)
- Use TypeScript strictly
- Implement proper error handling
- Add meaningful comments
- Use Angular CLI for generation

### Documentation
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Add screenshots for UI patterns
- Link to relevant resources

### Testing
- Write unit tests for components
- Test services thoroughly
- Include integration tests where appropriate
- Maintain good test coverage

## 🏷️ Categories

When adding patterns, place them in the appropriate category:

- **Forms & Validation** - Form handling, validation, dynamic forms
- **HTTP & Data Management** - API calls, interceptors, caching
- **State Management** - NgRx, services, local storage
- **Component Architecture** - Smart/presentational, communication
- **Performance & Optimization** - Change detection, lazy loading
- **Testing Patterns** - Unit, integration, E2E testing
